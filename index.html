<h1>Is AI Destroying the Internet?</h1>
  <p><em>October 18, 2024 by <a href="mailto:connor201168@student-schoolsofwestfield.org">Connor H.</a></em></p>
  <p>I often wonder what’s real (in the sense that it was created by a human) and what isn’t when it comes to internet content in the modern world. With AI content being so numerous nowadays, it’s hard to pinpoint what exactly is being truthful, or what is garbled and or outright incorrect garbage.  Typically when I'm surfing through social media, watching short form videos, reading small condensed articles, and gazing at eye capturing pictures, I often see a handful of these pieces of media with the same, or at the very least similarly styled, AI generated voices, scripts, and pictures, which really makes me wonder if what I am watching is truly “real” as well as making me question the validity of what people or articles online are saying.</p>
  <h2>The Growing Problem</h2>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence, while very useful, can also make many mistakes. In a lot of cases, it can show totally irrelevant information for what you are trying to read about. This can lead to a lot of misinformation and total trash on the internet as AI is unable to tell what is real and or relevant and what is not. For example: <em>(see image below)</em></p>
  <div style="float:left; margin:30px;">
    <p>
      <a href="badAI.png">
        <img src="badAI.png" width="300px" id="dressing">
      </a>
      <br>
      <em>AI confuses dressing (food) with dressing <br> (bandage)</em>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>Now, you may wonder why this is such a big deal? I mean, its not like anyone is profiting from this. But that is where you'd be wrong. A lot of times, creators of AI articles will, more often than not, shove an insane amount of advertisements to generate as much revenue from a user as possible. It also doesn't help that search algorithms like Google, tend to push these sorts of sites in searches as they also boost their own revenue.</p>
  <h2>How Can We Combat This?</h2>
  <p>In truth, there isn't really a way for us to outright stop this kind of content from resurfacing every so often. However there are a few tricks to keep an open mind to AI content so you aren’t fooled by it either.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AI Detection Software:</strong> Recently, very powerful tools have been created that are able to detect AI content like Turnitin and Copyleaks. However, these have the possibility to fail and always aren’t 100% successful (expect about a 97% success rate however)</li>
    <li><strong>Checking for Consistency:</strong> A lot of times, AI will like to switch topics randomly so something that it was talking about 5 minutes ago will be completely different from what it might be talking about currently.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate the Source:</strong> If whatever you are seeing, reading or listening to does not have a clear, well defined, or reputable source, chances are that it has been artificially generated.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What Can We Learn?</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, the growth of artificially generated content throughout the internet has become more and more prevalent, blurring the lines between what clearly is true and what clearly is not. It is important to stay alert and to always question the authenticity of whatever you see online. After all, what you could be potentially reading might not be entirely true and just made to fish for your clicks.</p>

                  <p>This blog addresses a problem that has been evolving over the years, and I think you made it sound very interesting by talking about how the AI spreads misinformation. The image that you used is a perfect example of how AI can easily spread false information, and it has happened to me with Google Gemini, so I agree that the AI can't be entirely trusted. Very interesting blog!</p>

                  <p>I'd agree with you there, thats for sure. Artificial content, while useful, has a lot of flaws in it's design as of now.</p>
